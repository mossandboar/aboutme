      <p class="text"> My name is Kala Radl, and I am a dedicated Front End Developer student.</p> <p class="text">I am Native Hawaiian and grew up on a cattle ranch in "Paniolo" country on the Big Island of Hawai'i. I have been a cowboy all of my life, and now I am pursuing a career that is more challenging on my mind than on my back. I deeply enjoy the new languages that I am learning, and hope to positively network with like-minded professionals as I move through the programs and certifications at <b>Thinkful.com</b>.

<div class="font4 orange-text">What are my favorite hobbies?</div><p>I am a father of 2 children so I don't get out much! I have always been an outdoor person. Working outdoors was what I did. I am a hunter. I have been hunting since I was a teenager. Hawai'i has some animals but it is mostly pig hunting.</p><p class="font4 orange-text">What is my dream job?<p>My dream job would be to work with a company who either offers quality, employable higher education to those with historically little option OR to work with a company who feeds people. Food and work are my top concerns because I have been without both and it hurts.</p>
  <p class="font4 orange-text">What's my favorite music?<p> The  music I listen to is actually all music. I don't really have a favorite type anymore because I have heard something I like in about every kind of music. OK, if I had to choose: Metal, Symphony, Opera, Bluegrass, and Ambient are what I like most.
